# Operating Systems

## üñ•Ô∏è Overview
This repository contains projects developed for the **Operating Systems course of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem**. The projects focus on key concepts of modern operating systems, including **multi-threaded programming**, **MapReduce**, and **virtual memory management**.

### üìÇ Projects

1. **Multi-threaded MapReduce Framework**:
   - Implements a multi-threaded MapReduce framework using **pthreads** and atomic operations.
   - Focuses on performance optimization and thread safety.

2. **Virtual Memory Management**:
   - Simulates a **virtual memory system** using hierarchical page tables.
   - Implements address translation, page swapping, and page fault handling.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies
- **C/C++** for system-level programming.
- **pthreads** for multi-threaded operations.
- **Simulated Physical Memory** for virtual memory management.
