## Overview 📜

This exercise focuses on implementing **MapReduce** using **multi-threaded programming** in C. You will implement a simplified version of the MapReduce model to process large datasets efficiently using multiple threads.

## Key Topics Covered
- MapReduce Architecture 🗺️
- Synchronization between threads 🔗
- Thread management and lifecycle 🧵

## Prerequisites 🔑

- Knowledge of **C programming**.
- Familiarity with **POSIX threads** (`pthread`).
- Understanding of the **MapReduce** paradigm.

## Structure of the Project 🏗️

The project contains the following core components:

- `main.c`: The entry point of the program.
- `map_reduce.c`: Implements the MapReduce algorithm.
- `thread_pool.c`: Manages thread creation, task assignment, and synchronization.
- `Makefile`: Script to compile the project.
